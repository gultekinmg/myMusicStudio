<p align="left">The formula must be entered in the form x,x,x where x is a number representing the degree of the scale you which to
represent (up to a maximum of 13). Therefore to show a maJO()r chord, type in 1,3,5 i.e. the first, third and fifth notes of the
scale. It is also possible to flatten or sharpen a note, just put a &quot;b&quot; or a &quot;#&quot; before the number. i.e. to
show a minor chord you should enter 1,b3,5 for a 7#5 you can enter 1,3,b7,#5 You can also enter a scale in the box. i.e for a
melodic minor scale enter 1,2,b3,4,5,6,7,8 When you are happy with the formula you have entered click on &quot;display&quot;. The
note the chord or scale starts on is denoted by the selection in the box titled 
<b>Root:</b></p>

<p align="left">The formula must be entered in the form X1,X2,X3 where x is a letter from A to G. The letters MUST BE IN CAPITALS.
If you look at the piano keyboard you will notice that every note is on the piano keyboard three times. e.g. Their are three C
notes. You can decide which A,B,C ... to show by putting a 1,2 or 3 after it. For example to show a C chord that has the E before
the rest of the notes type in C2,E1,G2 if you like you can also add a second C: C2,E1,G2,C3. It is also possible to show a sharp or
flat note, just put # or b immmediately after the note you want to flatten/Sharpen. I.E. For a C minor enter: C2,Eb2,G2 or for a D
maJO()r enter D2,F#2,A2. It is not absolutely neccessary to add the number but it helps.</p>

<font size="4">Formula for Scales</font>
</p>
<p align="left">The formula must be entered in the form xxxxxx where x representents the steps(in semitones) of the scale. For
example a maJO()r scale is 2212221 i.e. 2 whole steps, a half step, three whole steps and another halfstep.You can also put a number
before a step to denote a larger step than normal. For example 3223 gives a pentatonic minor scale i.e. a 1 and a half step, 2
whole steps and another 1 and a half step. The largest number you can use is 9 and you are allowed to enter up to 12 steps in
total. You can chage the note the scale starts on by selecting the note in box titled 
<b>Root:</b>.</p>

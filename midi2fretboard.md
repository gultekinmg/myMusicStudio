Leaving aside all other considerations, if there are 12 semitones (half-tones) there MUST be 6 Tones or Full-Tones

7 natural note names (white keys): CDEFGAB
5 chromatic note names (black keys) with two ways of naming (10 names all up):
C# D# F# G# A#
Db Eb Gb Ab Bb

On Guitars.
Guitars, as has been said above, span the same note names and same structures to create chords. 
To create a voicing for a particular chord takes time and patience 
	- it is one of the ways that you can tell if the sequencer (the person who sequenced a part) knows about guitars or not, 
	by the sound of the part; i.e. the voicings of the chords match what a real guitarist would do.
Each string can have between 19 and 24 frets, giving it a range of 1 Octave + Perfect 5th to 2 Octaves. 
An open string on the guitar is the starting point or 0th fret.

Intervals then proceed as follows:

Fret| Interval
-----------------
.01 | minor 2
.02 | Major 2
.03 | m3
.04 | M3
.05 | P4
.06 | A4/d5
.07 | P5
.08 | m6
.09 | M6
.10 | m7
.11 | M7
.12 | P8

In terms of MIDI note names/numbers, the guitar starts at E1/44 and continues to E5/92 a span of 4 octaves. 
if you are emulating a detuned guitar or a low 7 string guitar, the note name numbers may go down to B0/27. 
Emulating a high 7 string, the note names will continue up to B5/99.

Standard guitar tuning for a six string is; E3/68 - B2/63 - G2/59 - D2/54 - A1/49 - E1/44

These can drop by semitone to one of the following four tunings:
Eb3/67 - Bb2/62 - Gb2/58 - Db2/53 - Ab1/48 - Eb1/43
D3/66 - A2/61 - F2/57 - C2/52 - G1/47 - D1/42
Db3/65 - Ab2/60 - E2/56 - B2/51 - Gb1/46 - Db1/41
C3/64 - A2/59 - Eb2/55 - Bb2/50 - F1/45 - C1/40

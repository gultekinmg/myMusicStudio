## gathering all branches, may take awhile to avoid daily updates.	
All branches gotto be framed to form a Visiual Music Studio.	
But you can try yet those unordered pages now till then.	
I Try coding all in pure javascript for offline process. but iframe cors policy force me use a location.	
perhaps users may need to use a small local pretenter such as mongo.	
webaudiofontdata is a synthfont2 sound font collection indexed for easier handle forked from github.
